<H1 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__109_71977014"></A>Introduction</H1>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__111_71977014"></A>Purpose</H2>
<P>This Document is intended to provide an overview of the Lux
Backend system design. It should provide reference to developers, as
well as a reference to project advisors in order to help further the
project. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__113_71977014"></A>Scope</H2>
<P>	The Lux Backend system is a generic Multi-player game server-side
system, intended for use with Massive Multilayer online games. The
system is designed to be released open source for use by not only the
Philadelphia Game Lab, but also other game development firms who are
looking to develop online games without the resources that might be
needed to develop a responsive server side process. In order to
provide security for Multi-player games, an authentication system has
been included in the design. 
</P>
<P>	We believe that the Lux system is designed to be generic enough
for use by almost any Multi-player game, while still being complete
enough to exclude the need for further development on the server
processes. Since the Lux system will be released open source, the
code will be made available on GitHub for public access, however an
installation kit (or make file) will be included with the final
release. 
</P>
<P>	The first project built on the Lux backend is a Massive
Multi-player online game being developed in-house by the Philadelphia
Game Lab. This will allow for close work in development of necessary
features and improvements that may be excluded or overlooked in the
initial release. Development on this MMO will begin once the
server-side system has reached an appropriately useful stage. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__117_71977014"></A>Definitions
and Acronyms</H2>
<P>MMO – Massive Multi-player Online Game</P>
<P>BGT – Battle Ground Thread</P>
<P>HMBL – HashMap Based Location</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="__RefHeading__121_71977014"></A>
System Architecture</H1>
<P>	The System is broken into several sections that interact with
each other. The main functionality of the system is designed as a
Message Passing Server that takes in Messages from client processes,
finds the relevant recipients of the processes and  forwards that
message onto the recipients socket. In order to determine which
sockets the message is “relevant” for, we are developing our own
data structure that functions as a 2D HashMap of the game Map.
Sockets will be used for communication in order to speed the message
passing system. In order to ensure that all clients are in sync with
each-other, the client game process will pass all updates to
objects/sprites in the game onto the server, and all messages will be
passed back out. 
</P>
<P>	A database of all objects will be kept to maintain a record of
the current state of the game, and to allow new players to enter the
game at it's current state. The handling and sending of object
updates will be done on the client developer's end, however a
reference guide will be provided to ease in this processes. Clients
will be expected to send the “state” of all game objects,
including the model that the game objects uses (store on the
End-users local machine), the animation that the game model is
currently in (and the time of the animation if necessary), and the
location of the game object. Since objects will be updated on each
frame, and only objects that the client has changed will need to be
sent back to the server, we will minimize the traffic sent between
frames without compromising game or introducing unnecessary lag into
the game. 
</P>
<P>	The game will provide a portion dedicated to Authorization, which
will be an extension of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. Clients will include
an OAuth 2.0 system that is external to our server system, and can
either be of their own development or an external service such as
Google or Facebook. To increase security, the OAuth, and in game
Authorization are  kept completely separate from the message passing
server aspect, and from all other aspects of the server. In order to
validate the End-user and verify that they are the user they claim to
be, a static hashing method will be implemented that can hash a users
credentials to check that they are the user in question. 
</P>
<P>	Included with the system is a chat server, and banking system,
both of which can be implemented either with the game server, or
either should function independently enough to be used as a stand
alone system. The chat server will function as a chat server and
miniature social network tool that can be integrated fully with a
game, without restricting the game to any particular social or
hierarchical structure. The banking system functions as a store of
transactions for a particular user, or group, and acts independent
from the rest of the system in order to prevent any conflict. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__123_71977014"></A>Architectural
Design</H2>
<P>	The System is split into 10 separate modules that work as
independently from one another as possible while still creating a
full system. These modules are split into 3 major implementation
types, HTTP servers, continual socket servers, and helper classes.
The HTTP servers include an Authorization server, a Initialization
Server, a Social Network server, and Bank server. These function on a
HTTP protocol and will get in HTTP requests and return the output
from a compiled program that is run when the request is received. The
socket servers include a Battle Ground thread, and a chat server.
These servers all listen on a socket, and receive messages before
parsing them and sending a response to other sockets connected to the
server. The helper classes include a static authorization class, a
custom data structure for storing an end users position on the
virtual landscape (HashMap Based Location), a Battle Ground Spawning
thread, and a class designed to assign End-users to a given Battle
Ground thread (Find BGT Class). The functionality of these 3 modules
varies greatly and will be discussed in further depth later. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__152_71977014"></A>HTTP
Servers</H3>
<P>	The HTTP servers that are used within the game are portions of
the game that do not need to function as quickly as other portions
(eg: sockets), but still need to ensure reliable data transfer. The
HTTP servers will work by receiving a formatted URL request to an
HTTP server built into our functionality, which will be parsed for
parameters. These parameters will determine the pre-compiled program
that needs to be run, as well as the unique parameters to that
program. As an example</P>
<P>	<A HREF="https://localhost:3000/Auth?clientID=xxx&amp;AccessToken=xxx">https://localhost:3000/Auth?clientID=xxx&amp;AccessToken=xxx</A>
</P>
<P>would run the Authorization server with the parameters:</P>
<P>	$ auth -c xxx -AT xxx</P>
<P>and return the output from that program as the response to the
request. The response will be a JSON formated string that can be
parsed and interpreted in the client program. 
</P>
<P>	“{ 
</P>
<P>	EUID: \“123\”,</P>
<P>	 AccessToken: \“xxx\”</P>
<P>	}”</P>
<P>	For the request processing we would like to use a fully
functional HTTP server that can be adapted to return the output from
our compiled program, opposed to adapting or building a smaller less
capable HTTP server. We would prefer to use a system that can
directly run a compiled program rather than having an interpreter
read a php file that executes the program (this would add a lot of
overhead to each HTTP request). 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__154_71977014"></A>Authorization
Server 
</H4>
<P>	The Authorization Server is designed as an extension of the OAuth
protocol, and acts as a next step in the Authorization process,
without involving the End-User any further than an OAuth redirect for
log-in. The only extra step that the client program must perform is a
single HTTP request to the Authorization Server. After completing the
OAuth process, the client program will forward the information
returned (including the access token and unique client ID) to the
Authorization server. The Authorization server will then validate the
JWT formatted client ID as being a valid identifier and use this to
access the players End-User ID from a key-value store (either
Voldemort or Raik). The client ID will be validated using the static
Authorization class. 
</P>
<P>	Using the client ID returned from the OAuth process as the “key”,
the key-value store will return the unique End-User ID that will be
used in the game. The rest of the information returned by the OAuth
will be updated in the key-value store, but will not be utilized at
this point in the development, it is only stored for possible future
features. The End-User ID is a unique identifier that is generated
when a user first creates an account, and will need to be created
within the Authorization server if the user is not already a
registered player. 
</P>
<P>	After the End-User ID is acquired from the key-value store, the
Authorization server will call the static Authorization class again
to create a unique in-game access-token. This access token will be a
hash of the users End-User ID, a server secret, and a time bucket
representing the current server time. After creating this
access-token, the HTTP server will return to the client the End-User
ID, and the new access-token. The access-token is not stored in any
database, but the client will need to use it to verify their identity
on other servers. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__156_71977014"></A>Initialization
Server</H4>
<P>	The Initialization server functions to get a single HTTP request
in from a client, and respond with the Socket on which to connect,
and the initial objects in the client game instance that need to be
loaded. The request sent into the Initialization Server should
include only the End-User ID and the access-token. The access token
and End-User ID are then validated using the static Authorization
Class. The End-User ID is then used to access a document database to
retrieve the User's “Document”. This Document contains
information on the player location, XP, and any other player specific
information. This information is passed directly into the Find BGT
Class, which uses the document information to determine which BGT the
client should be connected to. 
</P>
<P>	After the call to the Find BGT Class, the Initialization server
will take the returned information, including the BGT ID and the
relevant “Bucket” numbers. The buckets will be described later in
the HashMap Based Location Data structure. This information is then
used to call the document database again, and find all the
information that is relevant to the client at the start of their game
play. The socket that the BGT is listening on and all the objects
obtained from the document database are then passed back to the
client as the response from the initial HTTP request. The client is
then responsible for loading the Sprites saved on their local machine
based on the information passed, and connecting to the socket
specified by the response. Once the client finishes initializing the
game session, they connect to the Battle Ground thread and begin game
play. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__158_71977014"></A>Social
Network Server</H4>
<P>	The Social Network server acts to receive requests from clients
regarding joining and leaving groups, adding friends, and removing
friends. A host of other features are included, but they all work in
the same fashion, so they can be grouped together into a single
functional description. The only difference between each call will be
the database query that is used to make the change to the End-Users
social network, or to retrieve information that will be returned. 
</P>
<P>	The basis for both the social network and the chat server is the
use of a graph database to establish and define the connection
between users and groups. Each user and group will have an assigned
Node, and the connection between the Nodes function as the
“Friendship” or “Group Membership”. Each HTTP request that
comes in will be formated to use a predefined query to the graph,
which will substitute certain parameters to return the desired
results, or edits. 
</P>
<P>	The Social Network Server will get the HTTP request containing
the action to be performed, the client ID, the client access-token,
and the necessary parameters for the action. After using the static
Authorization Class to determine that the client is sending an
authentic request, the server will parse the necessary parameters
into the desired query, and perform the query on the database. The
response from the HTTP request will be the response from the
database, which will be either a list of desired nodes/connections, a
success message, or a failure message. Failures may result from
attempting to make a query on a non-existent connection or node, but
should not occur if the social network is properly used by the client
program. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__160_71977014"></A>Bank
Server</H4>
<P>	Like the Social Network Server, the bank server will function as
a large HTTP API that can take in a certain defined set of changes,
and act almost directly on the database from the given parameters
after proper Authentication from the Static Authentication Class. In
order to add a second layer of security, there may be some need for
PIN code access or IP verification during a session. 
</P>
<P>	The basic functionality will be receiving, transferring, and
spending of in-game currency. Since the full functionality of the
Bank Server, and the necessary parameters have not been defined, this
section will be left unexplored. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__162_71977014"></A>Socket
Servers</H3>
<P>	The Socket Servers are designed to function as message passing
servers that receive a message on their own listening socket, perform
minimal processing and pass the message onto a sending queue that
sends messages on it's own sending socket. In order to keep the
systems response time up (and the client lag down) the Socket servers
preform as little work on each message as possible before sending
them out. The main functionality within each of the receiving sockets
is to find which sockets will need to receive each message, and
forward the message onto a sending thread. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__164_71977014"></A>Battle
Ground Thread</H4>
<P>	The Battle Ground Thread holds the main functionality for the
server, which is receiving and updating the objects during the game
play. The BGT will first open a socket connection to listen to, and
then receive messages on the socket to be parsed into JSON objects.
These objects will contain a header which contains the client that
sent the message, and the location of that client. The first query to
the HBML will function to update the location of the player who sent
the object update, and remove the reference to the old location. It
will also update the socket that the client is using- in case the
client is forced to choose a new socket for any disconnection reason,
without forcing the client to reconnect via the Initialization
server. 
</P>
<P>	The second call the the HMBL will be the location of the object
itself, and the radius of which clients will need to be notified of
this change. The radius portion will be static to the object for the
most part, although client processes will be able to alter this. The
HMBL call will return a linked list of the sockets relevant to this
update. This object update, and the list of relevant sockets will
then be piped off to a Send Updates thread that is unique to the BGT.
The Send Updates Thread will function only to traverse the linked
list of sockets and send the object update to each of the client
sockets that the update is relevant to. After sending the update to
all sockets, the Send Update Thread will pipe the message to a
Database Writer thread that will update the object definition in the
document database. This update, and the document database, will not
be accessed at any point during the game play, but is only used by
the initialization thread to prepare a new client who is preparing to
enter the Battle Ground Thread. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__166_71977014"></A>Chat
Server</H4>
<P>	The Chat Server functions along-side the Social Network Server,
and works off the same graph database as the social network server.
The functionality however is very different, and more similarly
reflects that of the Battle Ground Thread's functionality. As a
message comes into the Chat server on the socket it is listening on,
it will parse the message into JSON, query the graph database for a
list of relevant sockets, and send out the message to the list of
sockets via it's own unique Send Updates Thread. On each message that
comes in, the header to the message will contain the Sending user,
who will need to be authenticated using the Authentication class, and
the End-User's node in the graph database will have to updated with
the socket that the message came in on. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__168_71977014"></A>Helper
Classes/Structures</H3>
<P>	The Helper Classes and Structures are the aspects of the server
that do not directly communicate with the client process, but instead
are accessed by specific portions of the server for specific
purposes. The Authorization class is accessed by any process that is
receiving a message or sending a message to a client. The HashMap
Based Location is created as an instance inside the Battle Ground
thread and is specific to that Battle Ground thread. The Battle
Ground Thread Spawner is only concerned with data in the Find BGT
Class, and ensures that the proper BGT and proper number of BGTs are
currently online; it is the only Helper class that runs continually-
and will be used as the main thread that launches all the other
threads and ensures that they are still online. The Find BGT Class
will share many elements with the HMBL class, and will have many of
it's methods statically called from the HMBL class, but will run
separate to the BGT as a way to track the BGTs and determine the
proper BGT for a client to connect to. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__170_71977014"></A>Authorization
Class</H4>
<P>	The Authorization class is designed to be a static class,
accessible from any other server component, in order to authorize
clients without communication between individual threads. The
functions within the Authorization class are static and the class
will be called from various points in the system. The methods include
a method to create an access token from the End-User ID, the Time
bucket, and the server secret. One to verify that the access token
matches the End-User ID, which will rehash the token and compare it
to the token passed in. A method to authenticate the JWT from the
OAuth process, which will follow the standards laid out for
Authenticating a JWT, which will return the unique identifier from
the JWT. 
</P>
<P>	Lastly, the Authorization Class will contain a method for
refreshing a User token if it has expired, which will rehash the
passed token using the previous time bucket and make sure that it
matches, and then create a  new token in the current time bucket and
return that. This method will be called anytime that a access token
fails, but will need to be called from outside of the class. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__172_71977014"></A>HashMap
Based Location 
</H4>
<P>	The HashMap Based Location tool is the heart of the systems
ability to quickly process which clients need to be updated of
changes to an object, and quickly determining the location of an
object relative to other objects on the virtual map. The actual HMBL
stores only the clients and their respective sockets, which allows
for quickly compiling a list of sockets that a message needs to be
sent to. The HMBL tool is instanced within a BGT and is not a shared
data structure, so there are no shared locks, mutual exclusion, or
blocking- only the BGT accesses the HMBL. 
</P>
<P>	The structure of the HMBL tool is predicated on the use of two
HashTables. The first HashTable is used only to hold relationship
between a client and a pointer to their socket in the second
HashTable. This is done so that when a request to update the client's
socket comes in, the HMBL can immediately find and unlink the
previous socket. As a precaution, sockets are given an “expiration
time” when they are logged into the second HashMap which will be
checked against the current time when the socket is accessed. If the
socket has expired (without having been previously unlinked) it is
assumed that the client connection was terminated, and thus that
socket no longer needs to have messages sent to it. This leads to the
HMBL immediately unlinking the socket and continuing with it's task. 
</P>
<P>	The second HashTable is a linear array of buckets that can be
mapped to using a hashing function that is dependent on the clients
current x,y coordinates on the map. The bucket's virtual size is
dependent on the needs of the game, but is sized sufficiently small
that a limited number of sockets are mapped to any given bucket. The
HMBL's ability to return “relevant” sockets based on the radius
of the object is dependent on the linear array's ability to have each
element accessed in constant time given the index. If a socket is in
a given bucket, and the radius is 1 level out, then each of the
buckets around it can be found using a formula. This gives access to
the buckets at constant time, assuming the buckets can be mapped to
in constant time, and the formula to find the surrounding buckets is
constant time. The only growth is for elements with a larger radius,
there will be a large growth between the amount of buckets that need
to be accessed. Since within each bucket the sockets will be stored
as a (presumably doubly) linked list, it is still possible to link
them together in constant time by not traversing the list, but
instead just linking them to the end of the previous bucket's list. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__174_71977014"></A>Battle
Ground Spawner Thread</H4>
<P>	The Battle Ground Spawner Thread functions just to maintain the
BGT's and grow the map, or the number of arenas currently in use. As
the number of Battle Ground Threads needed grows, the Battle Ground
Spawner Thread will spawn a new BGT. This process is done by first
duplicating a document collection that reflect the starting state of
the battle ground thread being spawned (loading map elements, setting
the spawn points, ect) and linking that to the Battle Ground thread
that is being spawned, as well as to the Find BGT class. 
</P>
<P>	If a BGT should crash, or go down, then the Spawner thread would
simply request the database collection of that thread, and create a
new BGT that is linked to the existing document collection. Since
BGTs will be launched within the Battle Ground Spawner Thread, it
will be able to see if any BGT has crashed, as well as kill any BGT
that is no longer necessary. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__176_71977014"></A>Find BGT
Class</H4>
<P>	The Find BGT class maintains an active list of the BGTs that are
being played on, and contains a custom hashing function dependent on
the game type to find which thread a client should be linked to. Once
a client connects to the initialization server, the Find BGT Class
will be able to use static methods, and simple definitions of each
BGT to calculate which BGT the client is best matched with. Depending
on game type, this could be based on the location of the client, the
XP of the client, or the crowding of any given BGT. Each type of
mapping will be implemented, and client Developers will simply need
to specify which option they wish to use when the process is
launched. 
</P>
<P>	The Find BGT Class will access many of the statically defined
methods of the HMBL to locate the position on the map that the client
is currently trying to access, and be able to find all the relevant
buckets that will need to be queried from the document database. This
separation allows the BGT to remain solely accessible from the BGT,
while not completely isolating the information that would be needed
to connect a client to the BGT.
