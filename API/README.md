# API Tunnel
The API tunnel is designed as a way to allow users to make calls to 3rd party APIs that require either OAuth or App level authentication, all while avoiding CORS. If the provider is properly set-up and user's are logged in, then access should be relatively simple.

It is important to note that the provider will throw an error if the path/params are not properly formatted- or if the request being made is out of the scope for the user.

## Access
Access to the API is through the url 

```
/Lux/API/<api_name>
```

## Dashboard
The Dashboard has a management where provider information can be viewed, created or modified for App level providers.
