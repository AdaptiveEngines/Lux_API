# Content Management System 
The Content Management system can be used for a variety of purposes, including basic content sections or blog-esq posts. The main content can also have a shortened version attached. Header, sub heading, and url\_safe header's are also allowed- as are pictures and banner images. 

In addition, the template render system can be used to display content without needing to make a seperate call to fetch that content.

## Access
Access to the API is through the url 

```
/Lux/CMS/<api_name>
```

## Dashboard
The content management system within the Dashboard allows the editing and creation of content

## Logging
Any access to content is logged by adding the field name to the log

```
