# OAuth Gateway
The Auth Gateway is designed to simplify the OAuth 1 and OAuth 2 process by allowing developers to make a single request for the redirect url (sign-in button), which user's can click on to log-in. Once logged in, the user is assigned a lux access token, which allows them to interact with the system. Lux keeps the access token from the OAuth provider on hand for use when a developer wishes to integrate the system. Calls to APIs then automatically have the access token from the provider added to them. 

Social integration is done via the `/Lux/API/call/`, as a generic API system for all API calls

User's are able to log into multiple OAuth providers and have them linked to their account. 

## Access
Access to the API is through the url 

```
/Lux/Auth/<api_name>
```

## Dashboard
The Dashboard has a management where provider information can be viewed, created or modified for either OAuth1 or OAuth2 providers. 

## Logging
Logging is not done in this API
